MrThatKid name generator, made as a jQuery learning exercise. I have absolutely no idea why you'd want to use this, but if you really need it, [here you go.](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ElliottBelardo/mr-thatword/4998302bf0f3e84fcd06b3ce1d913ebebef7acf5/index.html)

The toTitleCase function was copied from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5086390/jquery-title-case) Stack Overflow answer, by Ben Blank.
